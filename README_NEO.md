## Installation

A standalone app will be available soon. For now, you will need to build the wallet manually.

### Required Tools and Dependencies

* Node (This project uses the current LTS node version, which is `v6.11.0`)
* Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### Developing and Running

Execute these commands in the project's root directory:

Setup:

* `yarn install` - Installing node dependencies
  * If you get any errors related to the node-hid package, please check installation instructions here: https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid#compiling-from-source. On Linux you may need to run `sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev`, for example.

Running (for production):

* `yarn assets`
* `yarn start`

Testing:

* `yarn test` or `yarn run test-watch` for live testing.

### Support

A gentle reminder, github issues is meant to be used by developers for maintaining and improving the codebase, and is not the proper location for support issues. Questions such as

* _"Why can't I log in?"_
* _"I lost my private key, is there anyway to recover it?"_
* _"Why is my balance not showing?"_

should be asked in proper support channels such as the [NEO subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/), or the official [NEO Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/R8v48YA). You should also check the list of [frequently asked questions (FAQ)](https://github.com/CityOfZion/awesome-NEO/blob/master/resources/faq.md) to see if your question has been answered there already.
